# Valkyrie Descent Campaign Template
This is a campaign template for creating [Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)](https://descent2e.fandom.com) campaigns in the [Valkyrie](https://github.com/NPBruce/valkyrie/wiki) mission creation tool.

A lot of the campaign logic is based on the [Community Shadow Rune Project](https://descent-community.org/index.php/fan-projects-fan-content/the-shadow-rune-project/). A big thank you to the creators of the campaign.

If you only want to create single missions without any campaign overhead check out the [Valkyrie Descent Mission Template](https://github.com/Quantumrunner/ValkyrieDescentMissionTemplate) project.
